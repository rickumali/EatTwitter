EATTWITTER
==========

This is the Eat Twitter website software. This website should be 
available at:

http://www.eattwitter.com/

EatTwitter aggregates the tweets of a select list of cooks. These tweets are
then examined word-by-word, aggregating all ingredients and organizing them
into food groups.

There are two main areas: front-end (front) and back-end (back). Read 
the README.md in the back directory for more details.

**IMPORTANT**

The front-end (front) code is meant only for development. It's not
designed for production use.
