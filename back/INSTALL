Rough installation steps for the "back" end processing.

CREATE THE DATABASE and TABLES
------------------------------

Create the database as you normally would.

Then create the tables using the mysql_database_schema.sql:

[eattwitter@domU-12-31-39-00-59-07 back]$ mysql -u dbuser -p eattwitter < mysql_database_schema.sql

Optionally create a username that is read-only (grant select) for 
front end.

Copy the template files so that they are now _config.php files (remove
the "-template" from their name). Then edit the settings to reflect the
back end.

$ cp 140dev_config-template.php 140dev_config.php
$ cp db_config-template.php db_config.php
$ vim 140dev_config.php db_config.php

Run "php db_test.php" and "php db_status.php" to confirm that the settings
"worked" and that the tables are present in the system.

CREATE THE VOCABULARY
---------------------

$ php make_vocabulary_list.php
Wrote 18 lines to vocabulary.list from dairy.list.
Wrote 42 lines to vocabulary.list from dessert-sweet.list.
Wrote 97 lines to vocabulary.list from fruit-vegetable.list.
Wrote 217 lines to vocabulary.list from grain-bread-pasta.list.
Wrote 39 lines to vocabulary.list from protein.list.
$ wc vocabulary.list
  419   468 10338 vocabulary.list

OPTIONALLY UPDATE THE USER LIST
-------------------------------

Use getuserid.php script, and paste the IDs (the lines with the "=>" 
into the file follow.list:

$ php getuserid.php rickumali
16067265 => Rick Umali (rickumali)
16067265
