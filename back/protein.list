# "Proteins are biochemical compounds consisting of one or more polypeptides
# typically folded into a globular or fibrous form, facilitating a biological
# function."
#
# "Meat is animal flesh that is used as food."
# 
# "Legume seed and foliage have a comparatively higher protein content than
# non-legume material, probably due to the additional nitrogen that legumes
# receive through nitrogen-fixation symbiosis. The high protein content makes
# them desirable crops in agriculture."
